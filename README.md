# Surfs_Up
# Overview
The purpose of this module challenge was to manipulate and analyze temperature data from the island of Oahu, Hawaii in order to assess whether or not it is a viable location for a new surf/ice cream shop.

## Results
- June is observed to exhibit an average temperature of 74.9 degrees with a max of 85 degrees and a minimum of 64 degrees.
- December has an average of 71 degrees with a max of 83 degrees and a minimum of 56 degrees.
- While the means of both months are relatively close (by 3 or so degrees), the temperature minimums are significantly different.

## Summary
These data suggest that the there is no stark contrast in temperatures for the months of June and December. Thus based of these data alone, a new surf/ice cream shop is a seemingly good investment. I would additionally perform a query that returns temperature data from all months as December is not always the coldest and is perhaps not the best month to compare. One could also query the precipitation values for June and December as rain and drizzle can affect customers for any given day
